Hi,

I've finished migrating the $DOMAIN website. You can view the result using this Website Preview link:
(This link is valid for 24 hours. Do NOT log in to the website backend as an Admin using this link, as it can break the site.)

### run this to generate preview - /root/ukd/tools/web-preview/generate-all $DOMAIN

Please thoroughly check the website, including any email/contact functionality.
### (Note that ReCAPTCHA doesn't like our Preview domain, so to test the Contact page you may need to edit your computer's Hosts file - as described further below.)

Mail Sync
---------

### You should perform a Mail Sync now, to copy the emails across, and again after DNS has fully propagated, to catch any emails that were delivered to the old account.
You can do that by logging into the GURU portal (https://my.guru.co.uk), then at the top click on 'Migration' (next to Help & Support), then click on Migration Mail Sync, finally enter the email details, including the old IMAP server (which is ###), and then click on Begin Sync.

### More details here:
https://my.guru.co.uk/kb/migration-info/migrating-email-to-guru
### If there is a need to check for any urgent emails, then I suggest also checking the old host's Webmail service.

Making DNS changes
------------------

If you are happy with the results, then you can change the nameservers to be ours (at the registrar of the domain):

Email users will also need to change their incoming (POP/IMAP) & outgoing (SMTP) mail servers to:
mail2.guru.net.uk
And if they are not using SSL, then they will need to change to that & ensure they are using the corresponding ports - see here for more details:

You can get more details from the cPanel account, by clicking on Email Accounts, and then on Connected Devices.

Editing your Hosts file

If you wish to login to the website backend (as an Admin) before the DNS has propagated to you
or before making the DNS changes,
then you will need to temporarily edit your computer's Hosts file:
